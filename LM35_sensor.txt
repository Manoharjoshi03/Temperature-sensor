LM35 Temperature Sensor

Introduction

The LM35 is a precision analog temperature sensor from Texas Instruments.
It provides an output voltage that is linearly proportional to the Celsius temperature.
Unlike thermistors, the LM35 does not require any external calibration or trimming and 
maintains an accuracy of ±0.5°C at room temperature.

Features

* Direct temperature output in °C
* Linear scale factor: 10 mV/°C
* Operating temperature range: -55°C to +150°C
* Accuracy: ±0.5°C (at 25°C)
* Operating voltage: 4V to 30V
* Low self-heating: < 0.1°C in still air
* Output impedance: < 0.1Ω
* Can be used with Arduino, ESP32, STM32, and other ADC-enabled microcontrollers

Working Principle

The LM35 works based on the principle that the base-emitter voltage of a diode-connected
transistor changes predictably with temperature. Internally, the LM35 uses a series of precisely 
matched transistors biased at different current levels to produce a voltage that varies linearly 
with temperature.

Output Voltage Formula

Vout = 10mV × Temperature(°C)

For example:

* At 25°C → Output = 250 mV
* At 0°C → Output = 0 mV
* At 100°C → Output = 1000 mV (1V)

You can convert this voltage into temperature using:

Temperature (°C) = Vout (in volts) × 100

Interfacing with Microcontroller

To read the temperature:

1. Connect Vout of LM35 to an ADC pin of the microcontroller.
2. Perform an analogRead to get ADC value.
3. Convert ADC value to voltage.
4. Multiply by 100 to get temperature in Celsius.

Arduino (10-bit ADC, 0–5V):

voltage = analogRead(A0) * (5.0 / 1023.0);
temperature = voltage * 100;

ESP32 (12-bit ADC, 0–3.3V):

voltage = analogRead(36) * (3.3 / 4095.0);
temperature = voltage * 100;

Applications

* Weather monitoring systems
* Battery management systems
* Home automation
* Industrial temperature control
* IoT environment sensing
* Overheat protection in power supplies

Advantages

* No calibration required
* Linear output makes calculations easy
* Compatible with many microcontrollers
* Low cost and easily available
* Accurate and reliable

Limitations

* Analog output is sensitive to noise and long wire lengths
* Cannot be used directly for Fahrenheit (needs conversion)
* Accuracy may reduce slightly at extreme temperature ranges
* Must ensure stable Vcc for accurate readings

Celsius to Fahrenheit Conversion

If required:

°F = (°C × 1.8) + 32
