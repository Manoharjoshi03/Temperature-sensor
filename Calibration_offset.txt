What is Calibration Offset?

Calibration offset is the difference between the measured value and the true value of a parameter being measured.
This offset can arise from various sources, including sensor inaccuracies, environmental factors, or inherent biases in the measurement system.
Correcting for this offset is crucial for achieving accurate and reliable measurements in various applications, 
such as sensors and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

Importance of Calibration Offset

Accuracy: Calibration offsets can lead to significant errors in measurements, affecting the reliability of data used in critical applications,
          such as medical devices, industrial automation, and scientific research.

Consistency: Regular calibration helps maintain consistency in measurements over time, ensuring that instruments provide reliable data across 
             different conditions and uses.

Compliance: Many industries require adherence to specific standards and regulations, which often include regular calibration to ensure
            measurement accuracy.
